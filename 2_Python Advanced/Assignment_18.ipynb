    "There are two types of files in computing: text files and binary files. Text files are amde of characters encoded in a human-readable format, such as ASCII or Unicode. Typically, these characters are letters, numbers, and symbols that can be displayed on a computer or printed on paper. Text files are frequently used to store material intended for human reading and editing, such as documents, source code, and configuration files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary files, on the other hand, are made up of binary data, which is represented in the form of bits and bytes. Binary data can contain any type of information, including images, audio, video, and executable code. Binary files, unlike text files, are not human-readable and cannot be directly altered without specialized software. Binary files are frequently used to store data intended for computer processing, such as machine code, multimedia files, and databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between text and binary files is how data is encoded and stored. Character encoding is used in text files to represent human-readable characters, and binary encoding is used in binary files to represent any sort of data. This difference has significant implications for how different software applications read, write, and process files."

When reading or writing data in the inappropriate endianness, erroneous values may be read or written.\n",
