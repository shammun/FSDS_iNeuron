The position of a substring within a longer string can also be found using the `index` method. However, the `index` method will throw a `ValueError` if the substring is missing from the longer string. As a result, it is a good idea to utilize the `in` or `not in` operators before utilizing the `index` method to determine whether the substring is present in the bigger string.
