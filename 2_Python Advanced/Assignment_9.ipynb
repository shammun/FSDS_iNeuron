Because `str` objects are intended to represent text, they provide a wide range of string-specific actions and methods. Because `bytes` and `bytearray` objects are intended to represent binary data, they support a relatively limited set of string operations and methods. `Memoryview` objects let you to interact directly with the memory buffer of a bytes or `bytearray` object, which can be handy for high-performance handling of large amounts of binary data."

    "\n",
    "2. **Line Endings:** In text mode, Python handles various line endings (such as `\\n` on Unix systems and `\\r\\n` on Windows systems) and transforms them to the `\"\\n\"` character automatically. Line ends are not translated in binary mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Reading and Writing:** In text mode, the \"read\" and \"write\" operations deal with Unicode strings, but in binary mode, the actions deal with bytes. This means that in text mode, the \"read\" method returns  a string, whereas in binary mode, it returns bytes. Similarly, in text mode, the \"write\" method takes a string, whereas in binary mode, it takes bytes.\n",
