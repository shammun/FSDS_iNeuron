A wrapper function is one that accepts another function as a parameter and adds functionality to it. The wrapped feature is the original function that is wrapped by a wrapper. The wrapper function can change the wrapped feature's parameters, return values, or behavior. Wrappers are often used in Python to implement programming features such as logging and caching. A decorator is a type of wrapper that modifies the functionality of a function or class by using the `@` symbol. A decorator is a type of syntactic sugar that allows you to change the behavior of a function or class without using explicit wrapper functions. A decorator is added to a function or class by inserting it on a line above the definition of the function or class. Decorators are often used in Python to implement common issues, such as adding authentication or authorisation to a web API."
