    "The main difference between float and Decimal classes in Python is the fact that the float class is used for floating-point numbers and the Decimal class is used for decimal numbers. Because it can represent a wider range of values and has a higher level of precision, the float class is better suited for scientific and engineering computations. Yet, due to its lack of precision, it is unsuitable for financial calculations. Due to its higher level of precision, the Decimal class is better suited for financial calculations. Unfortunately, due to its limited numerical range, it is unsuitable for scientific and technical computations."
