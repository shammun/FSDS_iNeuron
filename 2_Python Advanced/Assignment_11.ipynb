    "A metaclass in Python is a class that specifies how other classes should behave. This class builds other classes. Python uses a metaclass when you create a class to build that class. The type metaclass is the default metaclass in Python. When a class is defined,  Python makes an object of the type metaclass, and that object then makes an object of the class.\n",
