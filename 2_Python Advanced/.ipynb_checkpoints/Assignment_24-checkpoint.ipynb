    "With Python, you can utilize a dependency injection technique to avoid mutual importing. This allows you to express an object's dependencies as needed, rather than hard-coding them into the object itself. Furthermore, it enables you to simply replace dependencies with alternative ones in the future. A hierarchical approach is another option to avoid mutual importing. This entails breaking complex procedures down into smaller, more manageable activities and just loading the modules required for each job. This makes it easier to detect dependencies and import only the modules that are required. We can break circular dependency using interfaces An interface is a simple, abstract definition of a module's behavior that other modules can use to interact with it. We  can limit the scope of cross-dependencies and reduce the complexity of our code by designing interfaces. We can also develop a third module that both modules can import and that includes the functionality that both modules require. This helps to break the circular dependency and eliminates the necessity for module cross-importing."
