    "A probability distribution is a mathematical function that describes the likelihood of a random variable having a particular value or range of values. It is used to model the probability of a random variable taking on any particular value, and it is important in predicting the probability of certain events occurring. Several fields of mathematics use probability distributions, including statistics, probability theory, and machine learning. To predict the values of a random variable, the probability distribution associated with it must first be determined. The probability distribution can then be used to calculate the likelihood of a specific value occurring or the expected value of a random variable."

    "Yes, there is a distinction between true random numbers and pseudo-random numbers. Real random numbers are generated based on some form of physical phenomenon, such as atmospheric noise or radioactive decay. A computer algorithm generates pseudo-random numbers, which are not always actually random. They are deemed \"good enough\" because the method used to create them generates numbers that appear random to the user, despite the fact that they may not be genuinely random. Furthermore, the techniques for generating pseudo-random numbers are far faster and more efficient than those for generating actual random numbers."

The form of the probability distribution is determined by the mean and the standard deviation, with bigger standard deviations generating distributions with wider tails. The normal probability distribution is also affected by other factors, such as the skewness, which defines the asymmetry of the distribution, and the kurtosis, which is a measure of the \"peakedness\" of the distribution."

Yet, as the number of trials increases, the probability distribution is expected to become more stable, and the probability of certain values occurring will become more and more consistent. This is due to the rule of large numbers, which states that in the long term, the average of a large number of independent trials will converge towards the expected value."
