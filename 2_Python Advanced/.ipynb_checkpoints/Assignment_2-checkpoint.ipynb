    "1. Classes and objects: The concepts of classes and objects are essential to object-oriented programming in Python. A class can be thought of as a blueprint or design that specifies the properties and methods of objects, while objects are the actual instances that are created based on that blueprint/design. Since each object has its own unique set of property values, understanding how to create and manipulate classes and objects is fundamental to building effective object-oriented code in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Inheritance: In OOP with Python, inheritance is a key concept that empowers us to construct novel classes that leverage or build on the existing ones. When we develop a new class that inherits from an existing class (also called the base or superclass), it is referred to as a subclass or derived class. In this way, the subclass inherits all the attributes and methods of the superclass, facilitating the reuse of code and the reduction of code duplication. Further, we can define new attributes and methods for the subclass, and if needed, we can also modify the existing methods in the superclass. Understanding how inheritance functions in Python is a critical prerequisite for creating sophisticated and complex object-oriented applications that are both easy to maintain and scale."
