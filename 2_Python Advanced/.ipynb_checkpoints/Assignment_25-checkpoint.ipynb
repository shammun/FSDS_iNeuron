    "In Python, there are a few ways to perform indirect imports, which allow you to import a module or package indirectly by using a string or variable instead of directly importing it by name. Here are a few methods you can use:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Using the importlib module:** To import a module indirectly, we can use the `importlib.import module()` function. This function accepts a string argument representing the name of the module to import and returns its object. Suppose we have a string variable called module name that contains the name of the module we want to import. We can import it indirectly by doing the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "`import importlib \n",
    "module_name = \"square\"\n",
    "imported_module = importlib.import module(module_name)`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Using the __import__() function:** We can also use the built-in `__import__()` function to perform an indirect import. This function takes a string argument representing the name of the module we want to import, and returns the module object. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "`module_name = \"square\"\n",
    "imported_module = __import__(module_name)\n",
    "`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Using the exec() function:** We can also use the `exec()` function to execute a string containing an import statement. For example, suppose you have a string variable module_name that contains the name of the module you want to import. You can import it indirectly like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "`module_name = \"my_module\"\n",
    "exec(f\"import {module_name}\")\n",
    "my_module = sys.modules[module_name]\n",
    "`\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that using exec() to execute arbitrary code can be a security risk, so use it with caution and only with trusted code."
