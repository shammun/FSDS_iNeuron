Objects have both properties and behaviors where properties can be considered as data and behaviors can be thought of as the functions to be used with this data. A class is a collection of objects where an object can represent an entity like car with properties such as color, brand_name, miles per gallon and functions or methods such as break, move, accelerate, refuel etc."
