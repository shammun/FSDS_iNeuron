Firstly, it enables the reuse of the same regular expression object multiple times, which can increase efficiency because the regular expression only needs to be compiled once. Furthermore, compiling the regular expression enables you to utilize the same object with different flags, allowing you to use more powerful regular expressions as necessary. Lastly, compiling the regular expression allows you to utilize the object with various search functions, such as `findall()`, which increases the search's flexibility."
